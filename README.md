# HiRID - high time resolution ICU data set

HiRID is a **freely accessible** critical care dataset containing data relating to more than 34 thousand patient admissions to the Department of Intensive Care Medicine of the Bern University Hospital, Switzerland (ICU), an interdisciplinary 60-bed unit admitting >6,500 patients per year. The ICU offers the full range of modern interdisciplinary intensive care medicine for adult patients. The dataset was developed in cooperation between the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Z체rich, Switzerland and the ICU.

The dataset contains de-identified demographic information and a total of 712 routinely collected physiological variables, diagnostic test results and treatment parameters from more than 34 thousand admissions during the period from January 2008 to June 2016. Data is stored with a uniquely high time resolution of one entry every two minutes.
